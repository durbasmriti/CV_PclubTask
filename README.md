#### Google drive link for the datasets :
Female_wearing_mask : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1--pF1PnyQxZIr53PBH19H5xvKqolY0EI?usp=drive_link
Male_wearing_mask : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pE62nFCIBQGYUUwLXj2lPeeR9qYhX6R_?usp=drive_link

## Approach to find datasets :
-Firstly I tried finding it online and found this https://buffml.com/face-mask-detection-gender-age-prediction/  but here most of the male pictures were of same person so lagged diversity and the images were no labelled , still I thought to work with this only so I made two folders in drive one Female_wearing_mask and the other is male_wearing mask but started uploading images by myself , took some pictures from the link above too .

-After I uploaded approximately 200 pictures in each category I was tired  AND soon I realised this not gonna work so I tried searching online if there were any othe sites like Kaggle where datsets are found .

-Finally I came across a YouTube video about ###bing_image_downloader and my search ended here . 

-On google colab , I connected google drive to it and used bing_image_downloader and uploaded more than 500 pictures in each category .

-And yes now my two folders in google drive wwere not empty anymore :)

## Instructions on how to run the code 
- download the datasets in your google drive
- connect google with google drive(code included in the code file)
- open the code with google colab
- In Google colab go to "Runtime" -> "change runtime type " to GPU preferably to increase the efficiency of the code
- Run the code with patience because it will take a lot of your time
